# Pipelines and Text Data Analysis
Analysis using pipelines and text data conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Chosen Data Set and Its Suitability for Analysis with Text Processing
The IMDb dataset is ideal for text processing analysis due to its inclusion of movie reviews with sentiment labels, making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks. Derived from real user reviews, it offers practical relevance and reflects genuine opinions. With 50,000 diverse reviews containing varied vocabulary, slang, and cases, the dataset requires comprehensive analysis and data cleaning. Its substantial size, accessibility, and widespread use make it valuable for research. Text processing techniques such as TF-IDF, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be applied to uncover sentiment patterns, identify topics, and understand overall sentiment distribution. This analysis has applications in market research, recommendation systems, and understanding user opinions on movies.

## Analysis Objectives
The analysis on the IMDb dataset involves exploring the structure of the data, conducting sentiment analysis to predict positive or negative sentiments in movie reviews, and extracting topics using LDA. The process includes loading the dataset, text preprocessing, visualizing and understanding the data, feature extraction using TF-IDF, applying machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis, and evaluating model performance. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for sentiment prediction and to uncover meaningful topics within the reviews using LDA. The evaluation includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
